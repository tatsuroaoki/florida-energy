# Charting Library
The following charting libraries were used to display data showing Florida's total energy consumption and renewable energy production:

google.charts.load('current', {packages: ['corechart']});

# Chart Type
I decided to choose Google Chart's curveType = 'function' and used LineChart to show the data. LineChart was used because I wanted to clearly show the how energy consumption and renewable energy production have changed since 1960, respectively.
